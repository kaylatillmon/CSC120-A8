Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I chose addTitle() in library because I know that in libraries you can have multiple copies of books and it would be cool to represent that. Also, to allow book keepers to add books using the author and genre (as well as title) because I felt that was more representative of the library experience.

I chose sellCoffee() in cafe because I thought it would be fun to represent how cafe's have specialized drinks that you can't really customize all too much, but also to represent how there can be customizable specials but those customizations are very light. 

I chose moveIn() and moveOut() in House because students have names and it would be nice to represent the name of the student who moves in and out of a building. I used my name as an example in CampusMap because I did move out of Capen House and then moved into Scales, so it was fun to see that representation of my experience at Smith.

This assignment was pretty fun! I would say what worked was, once again, starting early but starting simple too and thinking about how your overloaded and overwritten methods connect back to the original method and what is the best way to construct new methods while preserving the purpose of the original. For these assignments, try to have one it. it is a lot easier to code when you're making methods and testing them over things that you like and it also makes just a tiny bit more sense when you do that.
